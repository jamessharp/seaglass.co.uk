Born in Cape Town in 1957, I moved to England via the States, was brought up in Oxford, read English at Cambridge, then worked and travelled in Africa and India.</p><p>Following this I worked in art publishing, as a manager for classical musicians and then as a journalist for the Independent. A growing interest in jewellery led to part time study at the London Guildhall University (John Cass) 1993-5 and a further year (1998-9) at Camberwell College of Arts in London.</p><p>I have specialised in jewellery from sea-glass because of the beauty in these simple, tide-tossed luminous pebbles of colour. My earliest pieces were inspired by glass picked up on a small stretch of shingle near Cape Town. I now have glass from around the world. Some I collect, some is sent by friends. My first necklaces were bought by the Agete gallery in Tokyo, and The Sea Glass Collection was originally shown in Liberty, London.</p><quote>"I want to keep that feeling of excitement when you pick up what appears as a droplet of emerald, sapphire, amber or frosted crystal glowing in the shingle or left shining on sand smoothed by a receding wave - these jewels should retain a feel of captured light and wanderlust when worn."</quote></div></div></div></body></html>
